I am Mounika Vanka and I am currently working as a Researcher at Lenovo Research. I get the opportunity to work on the most interesting and state of the art prototypes and ideas in the field of Augmented Reality, Machine Learning, Voice Recognition, and Natural Language Processing to name a few. Every day at my job is a new challenge, to learn new technologies and concepts, and this provides the opportunity to make mistakes, learn and grow. 

I am a Biomedical Engineer by Profession and graduated from Duke in 2018. Yes, I am a huge Basketball Fan and ardently support Duke during March Madness. I did my Undergrad in Biomedical as well from India and for some time at Adelaide, Australia. 

My passion and Interest in Biomedical Engineering stems from a strong desire to work for the community and give back to the Society in every small way possible. I am very proud to be a Woman Engineer in Tech and would love to motivate other fellow women to join Tech, give them the motivation that I had received when I was a kid. I also strongly believe in Diversity and Inclusion and I am a part of three different Organizations at Lenovo which help the Underrepresented Groups. I also love attending Tech conferences, Grace Hopper being one of my favorites. The energy and atmosphere among so many fellow Tech Enthusiasts is amazing. 

During my free time, I love doing Escape Rooms. I feel they challenge you and always push you to do your best while being fun at the same time. I also paint, and love being outdoors and playing sports, tennis being my favorite. I also love travelling and have been fortunate enough to get the opportunity to travel to three different continents and still counting.
